## 📋 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global dataset of Data Science salaries in 2023. The goal is to identify how compensation varies based on experience level, remote work preferences, company size, and geographic location.

## 🧱 Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Overview of the raw dataset and initial previews.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling outliers in `salary_in_usd`, and decoding categorical variables (e.g., transforming 'EN' to 'Entry-level') for better readability.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries and visualizations using Seaborn/Matplotlib.
4. **Insight Generation:** Answering key business questions regarding remote work and high-paying roles.

## 🧠 Key Insights
* **Experience Matters:** Executive-level roles show a significant pay gap compared to entry-level positions.
* **The Remote Paradox:** While many prefer remote work, **Hybrid roles** actually show the most consistent high median pay in this dataset.
* **Company Size:** Surprisingly, **medium-sized companies** tend to offer higher median salaries than large corporations.
* **Top Roles:** Data Architects and ML Engineers emerge as the highest-paying technical titles.
* **Top Locations:** Malaysia, Puerto Rico, and the US are the leading countries for high-paying data science opportunities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Future Recommendations
* **Predictive Modeling:** The next step is building a regression model to predict salary based on job features.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** Transitioning these static insights into a Power BI or Tableau dashboard.
* **Clustering:** Using unsupervised learning to group countries or roles with similar salary profiles.
